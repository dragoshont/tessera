## Delivery Workflow — Architrave

This repo uses **Architrave**, a config-grounded durable build control plane for
knowledge/automation, UI, backend, full-stack, infrastructure, product/runtime
verification, and learning. Read root **`architrave.config.json`** first.

**When `kind` is `knowledge`:**
- Ground in repository docs, scripts, skills, schemas, tests, existing instructions, and learning artifacts.
- Run configured `build` and `test` commands.
- Do not infer or request a UI platform, Storybook, design map, tokens, backend, IaC, or runtime lane. UI reconciliation is not applicable.

When `kind` is absent, use the application fields and optional `backend`, `iac`,
`ops`, `autonomy`, `workers`, `runtime`, `invariants`, `evaluation`, and
`learning` blocks. Load `knowledge/runtime-v2.md` for non-trivial durable work.

**Before any UI change in an application-profile repo:**
- **Ground first; reproduce, don't reinvent.** Open the design source of truth named in `architrave.config.json` (the `designSource` Storybook + the `designMap` glossary) and the matching platform knowledge pack. **On a native platform, also load the repo-root constitution — `constitution-apple.md` (Apple) or `constitution-windows.md` (Windows)** — the deep, source-cited native rule base (verbatim type tables/ramp, materials layering, system icons, the native component catalog, and the shared-screenshot conformance-audit protocol). Reproduce the existing component by its glossary name and specify only the deltas. Net-new UI must be mocked in Storybook and confirmed first.
- **Tokens are the single source of truth.** Take values from `architrave.config.json` → `tokens`; if a value must change, change the **token first**, then regenerate. Never hard-code colors/space/type that a token already owns.

**Before any backend/full-stack change:**
- **Contract first.** If `backend` is configured, ground in its architecture docs and contracts before code. The Service Architect owns the API/data contract; the Backend Planner turns it into the human sign-off artifact; the Backend Implementer builds only after that plan is approved.
- **Infrastructure is plan-only by default.** Apply/rollback is allowed only
	when canonical Run policy explicitly grants the exact target/operation. Then
	checkpoint, record a mutation receipt, and verify health/version/digest.

**Before any implementation:**
- **YAGNI ladder.** Do not build presumptive features. First try: delete/skip, reuse existing repo source of truth, native/platform feature, standard library, already-installed dependency, tiny local implementation. New abstractions, dependencies, flags, config, factories, or layers need current evidence, not a guessed future. Never cut validation, data-loss handling, security, accessibility, capability honesty, or the smallest useful test.
- **Durable Run.** Use `harness/architrave_runtime.py` for canonical Run v2
	state. Outcome, Acceptance Matrix, TaskGraph, events, policy, and checkpoints
	are machine-readable. The phase ledger is a projection, not an autonomy gate.
	Under `approved-program`, continue dependency-ready in-scope tasks across
	internal phase boundaries without asking again.

**Gates — must be green before a change is "done":**
- Deterministic: `gates/checks.sh` (POSIX) or `gates/checks.ps1` (Windows) runs configured generate/build/test and profile-appropriate JSON checks. `gates/reconcile.*` reports UI token drift when configured and is not applicable to knowledge profiles. `gates/backend-checks.*` covers backend plus plan-only IaC when configured.
- Runtime: use `harness/invariant_engine.py` and configured
	`harness/legibility.py` Web/Electron/iOS/deployment checks. Compile is not a
	product reality gate.
- Semantic: scale by R0-R4. R3/R4 require independent GPT- and Claude-family
	passes; R4 also requires security and policy review.

**Learning loop:** Keep private Run evidence under `.architrave/runs/`, isolated
workers under `.architrave/worktrees/`, and the HMAC key at
`.architrave/runtime.key`; all stay ignored by default.
Maintain concise tracked repo profile/lessons, validate stale facts, and never
store secrets or hidden reasoning.

**Never:** manually edit canonical Run state, let workers escalate policy or
complete tasks, blindly retry uncertain side effects, mutate outside scoped
policy, materialize secrets, or claim compile/plan/simulation as a shipped
capability.
